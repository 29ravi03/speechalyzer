There are several Eclipse projects in this folder

- Speechalyzer - the main project
- FelixUtil - some helper classes
- Spellchecker - the hunspell spelling checker
- CommandlineParser - classes to parse the command line

If you try to work with Speechalyzer you will see that there are some libraries missing

weka
jdom
log4j

and for classification you'd need the external audio extraction executable, i.e. openEAR
