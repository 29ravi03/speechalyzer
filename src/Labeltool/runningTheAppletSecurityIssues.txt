To run the applet in a browser, it must be signed, this command might be used to generate a certificate:
keytool -genkey -alias testCert -keyalg rsa -keystore myKeystore
and this to sign the applet:
jarsigner keystore myKeystore myApplet.jar testCert
The certificate might be exported like this (and then importet by the browser)
keytool -exportcert -alias testCert -file testkey.cer -keystore myKeystore

This does not work with the appletviewer, but the file
java.policy could be edited to grant the necessary rights to the applet.
grant codeBase "file:/d:/work/SymEmoTester/Recorder/*" {
	permission java.security.AllPermission;
};
The file is located at <JAVA_HOME>/jre/lib/security
